Thanks for stopping by 🙏🏻 — let's connect!

I’m a [Mathematics](math.ui.ac.id) graduate student at the [University of Indonesia](ui.ac.id), specializing in data science and machine learning applications. With a strong foundation in mathematics and engineering, my work focuses on optimizing algorithms and delivering data-driven solutions to complex problems.

Currently, my research explores the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for portfolio optimization, leveraging historical financial data to develop models for long-term investment strategies. My interdisciplinary background also includes material informatics, particularly investigating the stability of advanced battery systems during my undergraduate studies at the [Bandung Institute of Technology](itb.ac.id).

Beyond academics, I have contributed to projects in epidemiological modeling and resource-efficient AI systems. I am passionate about applying computational tools to real-world challenges, particularly in science and technology.

I am proficient in Python, C++, and modern machine learning frameworks, and I strive to bridge theoretical insights with practical implementations.
